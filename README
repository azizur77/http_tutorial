Let's build a dynamic HTTP server from scratch

We will cover just enough networking and HTTP to build a simple working server.
You will finish this tutorial with a 100 line HTTP server and completely
understand it.

Modern web frameworks hide most of the messy details of web programming and
present an abstration for us to work with. Unfortunately, they often hide the
clean simplicity of HTTP itself. If you're new to web programming, or have only
used frameworks, it is hard to see exactly what an HTTP header is, or how an
HTTP verb is specified on the wire. In this tutorial, we're going to start at
the bottom, and work our way up to the HTTP fundamentals common to all web
frameworks. As complex as web programming can be, we'll see that HTTP is clear
and simple.

We will look at basic TCP/IP, the socket abstraction, request/response
protocols, HTTP verbs, and HTTP headers.  Each of these is a topic worthy of in
depth study itself, but we're going to skim them all, taking just what we need
to build a working HTTP server.
